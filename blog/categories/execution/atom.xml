    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of <a href="GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a>, highlights the competitive advantages behind a number
of company virtues I admire.   A few of these virtues are organic growth, outstanding user experience, and a distributed workforce.</p>

<p>Below is an video excerpt from a fireside chat interview with Mr. Preston-Werner from July 2013, speaking to the benefits
of a remote workers, particularly developers:</p>

<p>One of the most memorable quotations from the interview is:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Companies that aren&rsquo;t distributed can&rsquo;t possibly say that they hire the best people.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I have the privilege of working at a great employer that also &ldquo;gets it&rdquo;.  Most of my colleagues are remote workers across
nearly every time zone.  Constraining your team to a single city is a self-imposed barrier,
particularly for creative work like coding that fits brilliantly with remote collaboration.</p>
