<p>GitHub WebHooks and Jenkins go together like peanut butter and jelly.
<a href="http://kohsuke.org/2011/12/01/polling-must-die-triggering-jenkins-builds-from-a-git-hook/">SCM Webhook trggers are way more efficient for Jenkins over SCM polling</a>.  Webhooks also give you a great UX &ndash; Jenkins reacts
immediately when you push a commit or open a pull request.</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of using <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-oauth-plugin">GitHub OAuth for single sign on with Jenkins</a>.
The security of OAuth really depends on TLS/SSL for protecting the token in transit,
so your Jenkins should use SSL when using GitHub OAuth.</p>

<p>GitHub&rsquo;s Webhooks have the option to perform SSL certificate validation.  I&rsquo;ve
run into issues with GitHub&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hookshot&rdquo; HTTP engine failing SSL verification for
otherwise valid certificates.  Most of my problems were related to installing
intermediate CA certificates on Jenkins.</p>

<h2>GitHub WebHook configuration and SSL certificate verification</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a pull request webhook failing SSL validation in GitHub:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-12-03-A.png" alt="Screenshot of a failed certificate validation in a GitHub WebHook configuratioon screen" /></p>

<p>GitHub will send a &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; webhook ping when you create a new webhook.  Note
that SSL verification failures will have an usual HTTP response code of <code>0</code>:

<p>The response tab will be empty:

<h2>Troubleshoot your SSL certificate with the Symantec SSL Toolbox</h2>

<p>Symantec offers a very helpful <a href="https://ssltools.websecurity.symantec.com/checker/">tool to check your certificate installation</a>
as part of their &ldquo;SSL Toolbox&rdquo;. The tool offers suggestions to remedy certificate
issues and links to download missing intermediate CA certificates.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a Symantec diagnostic failure due to a missing intermediate certificate:</p>

<h2>Using the Symantec SSL Toolbox against servers with IP ACLs</h2>

<p>A great feature of the Symantec SSL Tool is how the tool supports non-public servers
behind a firewall.  The tool will first attempt to verify your cert from
a Symantec server.  If your server is behind a firewall that denies public access
except for whitelisted origins, the SSL toolbox has a fallback mode to run a Java applet
in your browser.  The applet will perform the SSL verification
requests from local machine rather than a Symantec server.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TIP:</strong> GitHub publishes their public IP range for webhooks as part of the
<a href="https://api.github.com/meta">GitHub metadata API</a> if you wish to create firewall
whitelist rules for GitHub webhook requests.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Symanetc SSL Toolbox Applet and OS X Java security</h2>

<p>Given the recent security vulnerabilities of Java applets, getting the applet to run
on OS X takes some work.  Here are the setting I need to use the applet in Safari 7.1
on OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks) using the Oracle/Sun JRE 1.7 R71.
(I never succeeded in using the applet in Firefox or Chrome despite serious effort.)</p>

<p>I needed to enable Safari to run the SSL Toolbox applets in &ldquo;unsafe mode&rdquo; without prompting:

<p>I also had to temporarily downgrade the JVM 1.7 browser security level to &ldquo;Medium&rdquo; and
add an execption for <code>https://ssltools.websecurity.symanttec.com</code>:</p>

<h2>Green is good!</h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve resolved your certificate issues, you should see green in both the
Symantec SSL Toolbox and the GitHub WebHook requests after enabling SSL verification.</p>
