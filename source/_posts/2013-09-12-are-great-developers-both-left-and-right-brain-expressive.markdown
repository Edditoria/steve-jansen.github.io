My wondeful wife pointed to me this outstanding visualization of left vs. right brain expression.

It made me thing that a great developer is probably expressive on both sides: you clearly need the academic
properties of the left brain: logic, analysis, objectivity.  

But the right side creativity is also going to
be needed to create something worth using, something that impacts our daily lives, something with an
outstanding user experience.

What do you think?  Are great devs truly ambidextrous of the mind?
