Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of [GitHub.com](GitHub.com), highlights the competitive advantages behind a number
of company virtues I admire.   A few of these virtues are organic growth, outstanding user experience, and a distributed workforce.

Below is an video excerpt from a fireside chat interview with Mr. Preston-Werner from July 2013, speaking to the benefits
of a remote workers, particularly developers:

One of the most memorable quotations from the interview is:

> "Companies that aren't distributed can't possibly say that they hire the best people."


I have the privilege of working at a great employer that also "gets it".  Most of my colleagues are remote workers across
nearly every time zone.  Constraining your team to a single city is a self-imposed barrier,
particularly for creative work like coding that fits brilliantly with remote collaboration.
